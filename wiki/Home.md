# Sketchbook AI - Text-to-World Engine

Welcome to the Sketchbook AI wiki! This project is a fork of the original [Sketchbook](https://github.com/swift502/Sketchbook) 3D playground, enhanced with AI-powered "Text-to-World" capabilities.

## What is Sketchbook AI?

Sketchbook AI transforms traditional 3D game development by allowing users to build 3D worlds simply by typing what they want. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), the engine generates TypeScript code on the fly, which is then compiled and executed in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Real-time AI Code Generation**: Describe what you want in natural language
- **Streaming AI Responses**: Watch code being generated in real-time
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: Generated code runs immediately in the 3D environment
- **Context-Aware AI**: Trained on the engine's TypeScript definitions and examples
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local models

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your AI API key in `localSettings.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Start typing what you want to create!
